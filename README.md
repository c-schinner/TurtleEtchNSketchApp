# Turtle Etch-a-Sketch App
The Turtle Etch-a-Sketch App is a Python program that lets you create digital artwork using the Turtle graphics library. Inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy, this app allows you to control a turtle on the screen to draw and doodle. You can use the arrow keys to control the turtle's movement, change the drawing direction, and even clear the screen to start a new drawing.

# Features

Turn the turtle left or right by 5 degrees.
Move the turtle forward or backward by 5 units.
Clear the screen to start a new drawing.
